Welcome to FemiCraft!
FemiCraft is a huge client MineCraft 1.2.5 using the global mod "FemiCraft Mod" (This mod made by us).
The client was initially designed just for the female audience, but then we realized that many men like to play this kind of game...
So we decided to make this client "for all".

In this client you will play for a girl... Yes, girl... 
This is why we changed not only the skin, but also turned the whole MineCraft:
swords were replaced by knives, has made lots of women's clothing, kitchen items... 
And we not going to stop! We have plans for many more updates!

ATTENTION! In the client there are no scenes of violence, but to download I recommend to people 16 years and over. You can download and to 16, but take responsibility for yourself! (FemiCraft Wiki also contains materials 16 years of age and older!)
